Midlife Crisis

Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline
For my pet genius
My head is like lettuce
Go on, dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop giving
I'm thirty-something
Sense of security like pockets jingling
Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity
Down through the family tree
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you (you're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleedin' enough for two
It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis...
What an inheritance
The salt and the Kleenex
Morbid self attention
Bending my pinky back
A little discipline
A donor by habit
A little discipline
Rent an opinion
Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument
Midlife crisis
I'm a perfectionist and perfect is a skinned knee
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleeding enough for two
Midlife Crisis
It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis...
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleeding enough for two
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleeding enough for two
Go on and wring my neck
Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
Go on and wring my neck.
